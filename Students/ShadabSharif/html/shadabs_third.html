<h1>Welcome to my second page!</h1>

<h2>11/30/2022</h2>
<p>From the previous classes until today, I've been working on the school's main website. iw as apart of the frontend team and I worked on the images on the main page with Alexa. I changed the gym photo to a class photo that will hopefully be updated with the new Advanced Programmers Workshop class each year. Aditionally, I changed the photo in the middle of the page to a photo with a few students working. I worked with the CSS teams to create a new css profile for images. Hopefully new photos will be put on the website each year!  </p>
<p>From now on, I'll start working on my project. Right now, I don't have a clear idea on what I want to work on. I was either going to make a Robot and record the entire thing on my own or work on a game with Will, Nathan, Michael and Andrew. I'm learning towards the game at the moment. We are each going to have assigned jobs and call weekly in order to track progress. We do not have specific jobs as of yet but I do know we are going to do 2D modeling and Nathan will do most of it. We are going for an indie style RPG. We will probably be making it through Unity. We are going to create a seperate github repiository for it. I'm curious to see how this goes! </p>
