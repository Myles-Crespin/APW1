<h2>Welcome to my senior year project page</h2>

<p> I was in charge on the CSS front of the class website project. I spent my time working on a test version of APW1 to design differenct viewable differences that the class would ultimatly vote to decide how we would want our class website to look. My group and I then made this changes on the offical master branch so they would reflect in the actual class website. I learned how to play around with different CSS designs and that much of the code that was written years ago was doing nothing and was not needed for the class website. After learning lots and lots about CSS, I now want to learn more about HTML because that is what I struggled with during the class website project. My goals are to know HTML, front and back, and then be able to reflect that on my own project page by making it more advanced than it is now. I will use a program to learn this but I do not know which one yet. I want to talk to Mr. Golanka and Mr. Lindow about which would be good to use once I get back to school. </p>

<p> Update (12/8/22): I am going to learn starting from articals on html.com. </p>

<p> What is HTML?: HTML is the code that is used to write the majority of websites. This is becuase it is used to create pages which makes websites functional. HTML works hand in hand with CSS to help with the design concepts of websites. Therefore, this project with emphasis more on how to build than design.</p>
